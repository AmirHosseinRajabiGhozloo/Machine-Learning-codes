# 1. Permeability-Predictiopn

Prediction of the drilling rate of penetration (ROP) is crucial for maximizing the drilling speed and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel intelligent boosted neural network (called GAN-boosted MLP) to predict the ROP using the petrophysical and drilling parameters. This model is trained through two stepwise stages. In the first stage, the boosting structure (GAN) of the model is created and trained with the target (ROP feature) of the training dataset. This boosting structure enhances the modelâ€™s capability to understand the process complexity. In the second stage, the MLP network coupled with the boosting structure is trained with all of the training dataset. The proposed GAN-boosted MLP model provides accurate ROP prediction with both testing and blind datasets. To highlight the superiority of the proposed procedure, a neural network with a similar architecture and without a boosting section, MLP, is also trained and tested. The results show that the proposed GAN-boosted MLP network is more successful in ROP estimation than the original non-boosted network.

# 2. ROP-Prediction

an innovative Deep Learning (DL)-based procedure, named as multiple-input convolutional neural network (MCNN), is developed for estimating reservoir rock permeability. The proposed model fed by two different kinds of input variables, 1D numerical well log data and 2D feature images (generated from available conventional well logs). The model treats and handles each type of data with a compatible network, a 1D-CNN network for the numerical data and a Residual 2D-CNN structure for the image-based dataset. The outputs of two employed DL networks are merged by a concatenated layer. The proposed procedure is implemented on a real dataset form a carbonate reservoir, and qualitative and quantitative analyses of the obtained results reveal its promising accuracy and performance. The MCNN model offers several advantages compared to the conventional single-input networks including the capability of efficiently exploiting mixed data, reducing overfitting problems, and providing more flexibility and accuracy.
